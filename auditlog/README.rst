=====

Go to `Settings / Technical / Audit / Rules` to subscribe rules. A rule defines
which operations to log for a given data model.

Then, check logs in the `Settings / Technical / Audit / Logs` menu. You can
group them by user sessions, date, data model or HTTP requests:

A scheduled action exists to delete logs older than 6 months (180 days)
automatically but is not enabled by default.
To activate it and/or change the delay, go to the
`Configuration / Technical / Automation / Scheduled Actions` menu and edit the
`Auto-vacuum audit logs` entry:
