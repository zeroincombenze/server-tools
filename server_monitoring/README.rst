server monitoring
=================

This module allows in-database logging of some statistics in order to monitor
the health of an openerp instance.

Database indicators are logged (number of rows, table size, number of reads,
number of updates...), with a cron running each week by default. This cron
needs to be activated after the module is installed.

Some process indicators are logged (cpu time, memory) together with information
about the different XMLRPC calls made to the server (user, model, method).

Two crons are provided to cleanup old logs from the database.


Installation
------------




Configuration
-------------





To configure this module, you need to:

* Settings -> Scheduled Actions and tune the cron tasks

Usage
-----







=====

Just install the addon in your instance. You will be able to access the logs
under Reporting -> Server Monitoring.
