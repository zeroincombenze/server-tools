Access to technical features without activating debug mode
==========================================================

In Odoo 9.0, the debug mode grants every employee user access to the technical
features. This module enables persistent access to technical features based on
user preference.

Installation
------------





Configuration
-------------






After installation of this module, every employee can still access technical
features for the applications that they have access to by enabling debug mode.
Additionally, users can check the *Technical feature* field in their
preferences to gain permanent access to the menus and views that fall under
this category.

   :alt: User preferences

Upon installation of this module, this preference is already
set for the administrator user of the database.

In the background, this preference is mapped to the *Technical feature (w/o
debug mode)* group that this module adds. As an administrator, you can
therefore manage this preference from the regular Users and Groups menu items.
