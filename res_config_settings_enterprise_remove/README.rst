Settings - Remove Enterprise Fields
===================================

This module removes enterprise-only features from all settings views.
Note that it does not remove the possibility to install
Enterprise modules. If necessary, all Enterprise Edition code is still
available and can be manually installed via the Apps menu.

Known issues / Roadmap
----------------------






Keep in mind that this module does not mark the enterprise fields as invisible.
Instead, it completely removes them, so any modules that are referencing those fields in
the settings views will break.

Bug Tracker
-----------

<https://github.com/OCA/odoo-enterprise-remove/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
