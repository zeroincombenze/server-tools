Forwarded-for IPs in log
========================

This module makes werkzeug messages in the log show the IP the requests come from instead of the reverse proxy one.


Installation
------------





Only install the module in the database.



Configuration
-------------





You should be running Odoo with *--proxy-mode* or *proxy_mode = True* in your configuration file and have your reverse proxy set the XFF header.

This can be achieved with nginx adding the following in your site configuration:

    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;



Usage
-----







=====

If everything is well configured, you will see the IPs the requests come from in the log instead of the proxy one.
