Mail cleanup
===========

This module allows to mark e-mails older than x days as read
and optionally move them on IMAP servers, just before fetching them.

Since the main "mail" module does not mark unroutable e-mails as read,
this means that if junk mail arrives in the catch-all address without
any default route, fetching newer e-mails will happen after re-parsing
those unroutable e-mails.

Configuration
=============

This module depends on ``mail_environment`` in order to add "expiration dates"
per server.

Example of a configuration file (add those values to your server)::

 [incoming_mail.openerp_pop_mail1]
 cleanup_days = 30 # default value
 cleanup_folder = NotParsed # optional parameter

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* None
