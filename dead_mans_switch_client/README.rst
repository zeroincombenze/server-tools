Dead man's switch (client)
==========================

This module is the client part of `dead_mans_switch_server`. It is responsible
of sending the server status updates, which in turn takes action if those
updates don't come in time.

Installation
------------





Configuration
-------------






After installing this module, you need to fill in the system parameter
``dead_mans_switch_client.url``. This must be the full URL to the server's
controller, usually of the form ``https://your.server/dead_mans_switch/alive``.

This module attempts to send CPU and RAM statistics to the server. While this
is not mandatory, it's helpful for assessing a server's health. If you want
this, you need to install ``psutil``.

You can also have the number of currently online users logged, but this only
works if the ``bus`` module is installed and longpolling configured correctly.

Usage
-----






=====

This module doesn't have any visible effect on the client.
